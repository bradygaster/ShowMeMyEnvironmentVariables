# ShowMeMyEnvironmentVariables

This is a sample project I use in situations where I'm trying out new hosting environments and I might want to see the environment variables placed at runtime by the host. 

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.**
> Actually, probably don't use it anywhere you don't want to leak the behavior of your host to the public internet.
